## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a robust regression model capable of estimating the selling price of a car based on key attributes such as manufacturing year, fuel type, transmission, ownership history, and kilometers driven.

This project highlights:

- Structured data preprocessing techniques  
- Feature encoding and transformation  
- Regression model comparison  
- Performance evaluation using industry-standard metrics  
- Interpretation of feature importance  

The final model provides reliable price predictions that can support data-driven decision-making in automotive resale markets.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains structured information about used cars. Key features include:

- Car Name / Brand  
- Year  
- Present Price  
- Kilometers Driven  
- Fuel Type  
- Seller Type  
- Transmission  
- Number of Owners  
- Selling Price (Target Variable)  

The target variable for prediction is **Selling Price**.

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The exploratory phase focused on understanding relationships between features and the target variable. Key steps included:

- Inspecting data distributions  
- Identifying correlations between variables  
- Detecting outliers  
- Evaluating categorical feature impact  
- Visualizing trends using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps  

Insights from EDA guided feature selection and preprocessing decisions.

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

To ensure model accuracy and stability, the following steps were implemented:

- Removal of irrelevant features  
- Encoding categorical variables using appropriate techniques  
- Creating derived features (e.g., car age from manufacturing year)  
- Handling skewness in numerical data  
- Train-test data splitting  
- Feature scaling where required  

These transformations improved model performance and generalization.

## 🤖 Model Development

Multiple regression algorithms were implemented and compared:

- Linear Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Lasso Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  

Each model was evaluated to determine its predictive performance and robustness.
